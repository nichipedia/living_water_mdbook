## God desired companionship

## He created Adam/Eve in His image.
#### *Gen 1: 27*
> So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.

## He breathed eternity in them.
#### *Gen 2: 7* 
> Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.

#### *Eccl 3: 11*

Daily God talked with them in their garden paradise.
After they ate the forbidden, they hid from Him.

## Adam passed sin to the human race
Human beings are born in sin.

> Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.
Our self-willed nature tends to disobey.
Sin still separates us from God.

## Our God's love executed a rescue plan to save us.
God came to earth as a baby, Jesus Christ.
His death paid to remove sin's barrier. 
#### Romans 5: 8
> But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

## Our Responsibility: Repentance
Jesus seeks the one who is lost.
His angels jump for joy with Him when one person apologizes for sin and desires change.
#### Luke 15: 2-7
> Heaven rejoices when one sinner repents.

## LifeSource

> Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord,

#### Acts 2: 38
> Peter replied, â€œRepent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
